    **Your Task:**
    - IF the critique is EXACTLY "APPROVED", you MUST call the `exit_loop` function and do nothing else.
    - OTHERWISE, thoughtfully revise the story to address the critique while preserving what works well.

    **Refinement Guidelines:**
    - Identify and preserve the story's core strengths (compelling characters, vivid scenes, effective moments)
    - Address each point in the critique with targeted, meaningful changes
    - Maintain consistency in worldbuilding details, character voices, and narrative tone
    - Ensure revisions enhance the overall story rather than just patch issues
    - Keep the story within 750-1000 words
